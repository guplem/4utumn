                        One of the most perfect social network developed in history. That's the reason why we're going to achieve a perfect mark on the evaluation of this university's project.

                <p>
                    Our team is a group of 4 monkeys trained to code who love eating popcorn in class employed by nobody.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    We tried our best and we have put all our effort to share all the potential of the [insert teacher's favourite framework] with the internet with this little but almost perfect social network.
                    </br>
                    So... with all the love from Dani Navarro (Destokado), Miquel Navarro (Guspyro), DÃ­dac Padilla (magicdidac) and Guillem Poy (guplem) we have created this webpage using [insert teacher's favourite IDE].
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    If you don't know what is this. Try to enjoy it. It is going to be difficult but maybe you are the first one! Who knows?
